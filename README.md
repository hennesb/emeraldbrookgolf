Emerald  Brook Python program to track our stableford golf scores

This is a program I put togther for my golf society. The hole pars are hard coded to a particular course I have
plans to change this as input.

The program is command line ,due to time constraints I couldn't put a gui on it.

You need a sqllite database to be running and a python runtime.

Steps
1. Create a sqllite db called ex.db
2. Run db_scripts.sql to set up the table structure
3. cd to the directory where golf.py is and run python golf.py
